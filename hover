How copilot can help 

Automates API request/response code generation.
Suggests UI automation snippets (Selenium, Playwright).
Generates locators for UI elements (XPath, CSS selectors).
Provides code reviews and improvement suggestions for automation scripts.
Generates API tests in any language when provided with service code.
Assists with repetitive tasks (e.g., form validation, login flows).

⏳ Time Savings:

80% of boilerplate code for API automation.
50% reduction in manual effort for UI element selectors.
25-30% time saved with code suggestions, reviews, and test generation.

API request/response coding	3 hours	1 hour	66% saved
Writing UI selectors	2 hours	1 hour	50% saved
Writing API test cases	4 hours	1.5 hours	62% saved
Reviewing and improving code	2 hours	1 hour	50% saved
Writing a new test class	5 hours	2 hours	60% saved


What Copilot Cannot Do:

 Cannot write/maintain the entire automation framework.
 Doesn’t handle complex test logic or maintain test code.
 Human input required for high-level test strategy and framework design.

Conclusion:
Copilot boosts productivity by automating repetitive tasks, writing API tests, and offering code suggestions, but human expertise remains crucial for framework maintenance and complex test logic.
